# Breast Cancer Detection with Machine Learning:

This project explores a dataset containing measurements from 357 benign and 212 malignant breast tumors.  The measurements include values such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more.  It's all numerical data.  The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis and build a machine learning model that can take in measurements from a tumor biopsy and accurately tell the doctor if the tumor is or is not malignant.

Thanks for checking out the project!
